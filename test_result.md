# UI Test Results - Ranpak Product Configurator

## Test Summary

**Date:** 2025-08-08  
**Application:** Single-page Ranpak Product Configurator

**Test Framework:** Playwright with Python

## Test Results Overview

### ✅ PASSING TESTS

1. **Page Load Structure**
   - ✅ Page loads successfully at http://localhost:3000
   - ✅ All 4 category chips present with correct data-cat attributes: fillpak, padpak, wrappak, geami
   - ✅ FillPak chip is initially active with aria-pressed="true"
   - ✅ Product select has 6 options when FillPak is selected
   - ✅ All required DOM elements exist (#viewer, #viewerStatus, #productSelect, #reloadBtn)

2. **Selection and Status Updates**
   - ✅ Can select "FillPak TT" from dropdown
   - ✅ Reload button works and triggers model loading
   - ✅ Status text updates correctly to "FillPak – FillPak TT" format
   - ✅ Status text starts with expected category prefix

3. **Category Switching**
   - ✅ PadPak chip switching works correctly
   - ✅ PadPak chip gets aria-pressed="true" when clicked
   - ✅ PadPak chip gets .is-active class when selected
   - ✅ Product select options update correctly when category changes
   - ✅ First option becomes "PadPak LC" when PadPak is selected

4. **Responsive Design**
   - ✅ Mobile layout works correctly at 390x780 viewport
   - ✅ Media query (max-width: 800px) triggers correctly
   - ✅ Grid layout changes to single column on mobile (grid-template-columns: 358px)
   - ✅ .app__actions justify-self changes from "end" to "start" on mobile

5. **JavaScript Functionality**
   - ✅ All interactive elements work properly
   - ✅ Event listeners are attached correctly
   - ✅ Category switching updates both UI and data
   - ✅ Model selection and status updates function correctly

### ❌ FAILING TESTS

1. **Fallback Rendering**
   - ❌ No fallback element with role="img" created when 360° assets are missing
   - ❌ Fallback logic checks for XML existence instead of actual image assets
   - ❌ Console shows "object2vr shim actief: geen 360° assets" but no visual fallback appears

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: JavaScript Initialization Failure

The main problem is that the JavaScript in `app.js` is not initializing properly. The error "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')" indicates that the DOM elements are not being found when the JavaScript tries to attach event listeners.

**Specific Issues Identified:**

1. **DOMContentLoaded Event**: The `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', init)` may not be firing correctly
2. **Element Selection**: The `document.querySelector('.app__nav')` returns null, suggesting the selector is incorrect
3. **CATALOG Not Defined**: The CATALOG object is not accessible in the global scope
4. **Event Listeners Not Attached**: None of the interactive functionality works because event listeners aren't attached

### Secondary Issues

1. **Base64 Image Error**: Invalid base64 data in the logo image source
2. **Missing 360° Assets**: No actual 360° viewer images are present, but fallback handling isn't working

## Technical Details

### Working Components
- HTML structure is correct and complete
- CSS styling and responsive design work perfectly
- All DOM elements are present and accessible
- Focus styling is properly implemented

### Non-Working Components
- JavaScript event handling system
- Dynamic content population (select options)
- State management (active chip tracking)
- Status message updates
- 360° viewer integration

## Recommendations for Main Agent

### High Priority Fixes

1. **Fix JavaScript Initialization**
   - Debug why the DOMContentLoaded event isn't firing
   - Ensure all DOM selectors are correct
   - Verify the CATALOG object is properly defined in global scope

2. **Fix Event Listeners**
   - Ensure `.app__nav` selector matches the actual HTML structure
   - Add error handling for null element references
   - Test that all event listeners are properly attached

3. **Implement Proper Fallback**
   - Add role="img" element when 360° assets are missing
   - Display appropriate error messages for missing assets

### Medium Priority Fixes

1. **Fix Base64 Logo**: Correct the invalid base64 data in the logo image
2. **Improve Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure TAB order works correctly
3. **Add Error Handling**: Implement try-catch blocks around DOM operations

## Test Environment Notes

- Application served via Python HTTP server on port 8080
- Original Vite dev server (port 3000) was failing due to file watcher limits
- All static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) are being served correctly
- 360° viewer assets (XML files and images) are present but not loading due to JS issues

## Screenshots Captured

1. **Desktop Load**: Shows initial page state with correct layout
2. **Mobile Resize**: Demonstrates responsive design working correctly

## Conclusion

The Ranpak Product Configurator has a solid foundation with correct HTML structure, excellent CSS styling, and proper responsive design. However, the JavaScript functionality is completely broken due to initialization issues. The core interactive features (category switching, model selection, status updates) are not working, making the application non-functional from a user interaction perspective.

The fixes required are primarily JavaScript-related and should be straightforward to implement once the initialization and event listener issues are resolved.
