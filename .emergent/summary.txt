The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a legacy multi-page HTML application into a modern, responsive Single-Page Application (SPA) using Vite and React. The core challenge involved consolidating several  files into a single interface while preserving the original visual style and ensuring mobile and desktop compatibility. A major technical hurdle was integrating a 360-degree product viewer, which relied on missing  asset directories.

The engineer addressed this by implementing a graceful fallback mechanism for the viewer, preventing blocked request errors and ensuring the UI remained functional. The latest interaction revealed that the missing 360-degree assets are, in fact, present in the linked GitHub repository but require Git LFS to be pulled, which was not installed or configured in the environment. The current task is to resolve this asset retrieval issue and activate the full 360-degree viewer.

<product_requirements>
The primary product requirement was to transform an existing collection of separate HTML websites (e.g., ) into a single, modern, responsive web application. This new application must function seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices, consolidating all original functionalities into one interface. Critical visual requirements included maintaining the original color palette, ensuring the background image always covers the available space, and adhering to modern UX patterns, accessibility principles (WCAG), soft colors, clear typography, and an airy layout. Visual hierarchy was prioritized over complexity. The application should include a product configurator with selectable models and a 360-degree viewer. The AI engineer was given autonomy to make design and implementation choices, with an emphasis on thorough testing.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Single-Page Application (SPA):** Modern web architecture for fluid user experience.
- **Vite:** Fast frontend build tool for React applications.
- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Object2VR:** A tool/player for creating and displaying 360-degree interactive objects/tours, used here for product visualization.
- **Supervisor:** Process control system used to manage frontend and backend services.
- **WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines):** Principles for accessible web design (e.g., ARIA attributes, focus states).
- **Git LFS (Large File Storage):** Git extension for handling large files efficiently, crucial for the 360-degree image assets.

<code_architecture>
The application now follows a clear frontend-focused architecture, built using Vite and React, with legacy assets carefully integrated.



- ****: This file defines the frontend project's metadata and dependencies (e.g., React, Vite). Its creation was critical to establish a modern build environment for the SPA, as the initial setup lacked one.
- ****: This is the single entry point for the new SPA. It replaced multiple  files, providing a unified interface. It was modified several times to fix HTML parsing errors and ensure correct script loading.
- ****: This stylesheet dictates the application's visual appearance, including typography, color scheme, layout, and ensures the background image always covers the viewport. It implements the soft colors, clear typography, airy layout requirement.
- ****: This file contains the core JavaScript logic for the SPA, handling navigation between product categories (chips), model selection, state management, and the crucial logic for loading the 360-degree viewer or its fallback. It was frequently updated to resolve initialization issues, linting errors, and to implement the fallback mechanism for missing 3D assets.
- ****: This JavaScript file is a shim for the Object2VR 360-degree viewer. It was modified to prevent errors and crashes when the actual 360-degree image tiles (from  folders) are missing, ensuring a graceful fallback to a textual message.
- ****: These XML files contain configuration data for different 3D models (e.g., ). They define the structure and references for the 360-degree views. These files were copied from the original repo into the new  directory to be accessible by the viewer.

The directory  was created to house the new SPA, including a  sub-directory for static assets accessible directly by the browser.

<pending_tasks>
- Activating the full 360-degree viewer by retrieving the  asset folders.
- Installing  in the environment to pull the large 360-degree assets from the linked GitHub repository.
- Further accessibility enhancements (e.g., skip-to-content, improved ARIA for model selection).
- Micro-animations and speed optimizations.

<current_work>
The application is currently a functional, responsive Single-Page Application (SPA) running on . It successfully consolidates all previous  functionalities into a single interface. Users can navigate between product categories (FillPak, PadPak, WrapPak, Geami) using category chips and select specific models via a dropdown. A clear status message below the viewer indicates the current selection.

A key nuance is the 360-degree product viewer: it currently operates in a graceful fallback mode. This means that instead of displaying interactive 360-degree images, it shows a descriptive preview. This was implemented because the large 360-degree image tiles (located in  directories, e.g., ) were not present in the local environment, although the corresponding XML configuration files were copied. The blocked request errors observed previously were identified as 404 errors for these missing image tiles, which the AI engineer has now suppressed to maintain a stable UI.

The most recent work focused on understanding why these assets were missing despite the user claiming they were in the repository. The AI engineer confirmed the GitHub repository is indeed linked () and that  files are tracked by Git, strongly suggesting they are managed by Git LFS, which is not installed in the current environment.

<optional_next_step>
Install Git LFS in the environment and then pull the missing  assets from the GitHub repository.
